# Usage:

We are going to create an application with two basic types of users.
1) The garbage collector
2) The population
### *For the population:
 We will allow them to be able from the application to order a garbage collector
### *For garbage collectors:
We will provide them to be able to see the needs of a population within a radius of X km so (depending on the type of gear used for garbage collection).Once the alert is received as soon as the collector validates the client, he receives a notification and on a map he can see the movement of the collector in real time.
